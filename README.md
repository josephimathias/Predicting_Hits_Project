# Random Forest and KNN with Baseball data set

## Project Members:

**Data Scientists** - Joey Mathias & Daniel Torres

**Flatiron School** - Data Science Fellowship Module 5 Project

## Project Goals:

The following project conducts an exploration and analysis of Baseball dataset for 2019 season, focus on singles, doubles, home runs, sac fly, triple, sac bunt. The dataset was colected from XXX website. The scope of the project is to observe the accuracy of our models using Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boost, XG Boost.
 

Research questions:
1) How strong or week is our prediction to have a single, for example, given a certian launch angle and launch speed. 
2) Explore ways to improve our accuracy given imbalance in our data, by conducting SMOTE and Gridsearch.  

Exploration:

1. Random Forest

2. KNN

3. Gradient Boost

4. XG Boost.
